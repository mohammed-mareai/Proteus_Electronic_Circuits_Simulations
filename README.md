# Proteus_Electronic_Circuits_Simulations

This repository contains the simulation files for the guidebook "Basic Electronic Circuits by Proteus Simulating Software" by Mohammed Mareai. The book serves as an introductory resource for those new to electronics, providing fundamental knowledge of various electronic components and circuits through practical simulation examples using the Proteus Design Suite.

## About the Book

The guidebook covers 19 topics, divided into two sections:

- **Section One: Basic Electronic Components in Proteus (7 Simulation Files)**
  - Topics include operational amplifiers, diodes, transistors, logic gates, and more.
  
- **Section Two: Electronic Circuits (12 Simulation Files)**
  - Topics include ADC, DAC, encoders, decoders, flip-flops, counters, and other essential circuits.

Each topic in the book is accompanied by a corresponding Proteus simulation file, which includes detailed schematics and results.
